        * The length of the sequence
            For its input, the program gets a sequence of non-negative integers; each integer is written on a separate line.
            The sequence ends with an integer 0; when the program reads 0, it should end its work and output the length of the sequence (not counting the final 0).

            Donâ€™t read numbers following the number 0.

            Sample Input:
            1
            7
            9
            0
            5

            Sample Output:
            3
